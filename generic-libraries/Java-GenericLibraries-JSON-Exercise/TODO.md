Provide the proper annotations to the existing annotation class JSONMapping, which is accessed via reflection during JSON generation and is used in the class User

## Step 2: Reflections
Complete the methods in ReflectionUtils 

## Step 3: Generics
Using ReflectionUtils create a generic implementation of UserJsonMapper called GenericJsonMapper that works for any class passed to it

Use the tests to verify your result
